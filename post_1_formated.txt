JOURNEY OF THE MASTER

Once upon a time, my love for Engineering bloomed like a flower along the coast of a fresh spring. From the intricate workings of Newtonian mechanics to the mind-bending realms of Quantum mechanics and General and special relativity, I was captivated. Mathematics became the beating heart of my existence, drawing inspiration from the great minds of antiquity like Ptolemy, Descartes, Apollonius of Perga and Corpernicus of Alexander.


For me, mathematics wasn't just a subject; it was a way of understanding the world. The likes of Archimedes, Newton, and Albert Einstein fueled a fire within me, igniting a passion for creativity, one that blazes with a radiance that outshines the inferno from the conspiracy of peak seven suns. I could see the potential to implement my ideas, to create something truly remarkable.

Despite my love for engineering, fate led me to pursue mathematics in university, where I graduated with second-class honors, upper division. However, the jobs I found didn't align with my creative vision. Crunching numbers for GDP calculations or teaching repetitive lessons felt like a betrayal of my aspirations, for they taught what has already been taught them, shall i too re-teach what has already been taught? and those i teach, arise and begin  to teach?.

I yearned for something new, something adventurous, something that would allow me to apply my mathematical skills to craft mind-blowing innovations. My dreams soared beyond the confines of our solar system, envisioning AI-powered robots, interstellar spaceships, and groundbreaking mathematical solutions that peeks into or exposes the fundamental utilities of entities at their nano-molecular scale.

In the depths of despair, a ray of hope shone through. The Alx Africa scholarship program, powered by Holberton Inc., offered me the chance to pursue a Software Engineering course. With determination and grit, i fought a fierce battle, like the bat	tle of merribah, as vicious as the war of amaggedom, i stood my ground with unshakable feet, like unmoving pillars planted in the center of the universe, i stood proudly upon the crushed head of my challanges posed by the african society, a psychological battle, a sociological battle and a pereonality battle; i came out a more than a conqueror and graduated with flying colors with the help of my God Jesus Christ, transforming into the engineer I had always dreamed of becoming.

Now, I create apps that solve real-world commercial challenges, i create stuff that streamline processes in the aeronautical space industry, i create stuff that empower individuals to approach their work with ease and satisfaction. i create stuff! i create things! I am a creator, a builder of the phenomenal, i CREATE!, this is the single most important thing that make me the Me.

I express my deepest gratitude to God and Alx Africa for the opportunities they have bestowed upon me. With newfound skills from the AICE program, I confidently navigate professional design tools like Figma and Uizzard, delve into AI toolkits, and conduct in-depth data research using Google Workspace tools.

This journey has not only fulfilled my fantasies but has also expanded the horizons of my explorative imagination. As I continue on this path, I am excited to see where my creativity will lead me next. The adventure is just beginning. ðŸš€
