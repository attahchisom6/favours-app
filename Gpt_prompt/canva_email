Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Graduate Software Engineer (Backend / Frontend) position at Canva, as advertised. With a strong educational background in Mathematics and extensive experience in backend and full-stack development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects that will shape the future of technology.

At the University of Nigeria Nsukka, I acquired a solid foundation in problem-solving and critical thinking, graduating with a Second Class Honors, Upper Division. My passion for software engineering led me to participate in the ALX Software Engineering program powered by Holberton Inc., where I honed my skills in backend and frontend development using technologies such as Python, JavaScript, MongoDB, and React.

My experience aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined in the job description. I have collaborated with teams to design, develop, and test software applications, ensuring high-quality work in a fast-paced environment. I am proficient in Python and JavaScript, with a firm grasp of Computing and Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals. Additionally, my experience in documentation and performance optimization further strengthens my candidacy for this role.

What excites me most about Canva is the opportunity to work with a diverse and talented team, contributing to projects that have a global impact. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion for technology to bring new ideas to the table, improve processes, and deliver features that enhance the Canva experience for users worldwide.

I am based in Nigeria and am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to Canva's team remotely. I understand that Canva may prefer candidates based in Australia or New Zealand and may not be able to sponsor visas or relocate candidates for the Early Talent program. However, I am fully committed to adhering to all legal requirements and am willing to explore alternative arrangements, such as remote work. I am available for interviews at your earliest convenience and can be reached via phone at 07039009306 or email at attahchisom2gmail.com. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of Canva.
