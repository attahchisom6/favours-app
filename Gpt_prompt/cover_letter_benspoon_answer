Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the software engineering position at Bending Spoons in Milla, Italy. As a backend Software Engineer who has undergone the ALX Software Engineering scholarship program sponsored by Holberton Inc., I seek this role to develop and upgrade my skills to solve real-world problems and create greatness.

Given that your company uses Python, in which I am very proficient, and works with mobile development, which is an area I strive towards becoming a leading figure in, I am truly enthusiastic about this role. More importantly, as an intern, I seek to make a real-world contribution to an organization, to see that I am directly related to the development and success of a product.

My hands-on experience in MongoDB, MySQL, Python, C, and Node.js, coupled with proficiency in frontend frameworks such as JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, has equipped me with a diverse and robust skill set. I have leveraged these skills to develop sophisticated mathematical tools using Node.js/Express. I am confident that my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset position me as a strong candidate for this role.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and am eager to discuss further how my skills align with your companyâ€™s needs. Please find attached my CV for your perusal. I kindly request that if you do not find my profile suitable, could you please provide me with feedback on how I can improve?

I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Attah Chisom Moses
