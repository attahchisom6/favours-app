Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the software engineering position at your esteemed company. As a graduate of Mathematics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka with second-class honors, I have refined my analytical skills, which perfectly complement my passion for applying mathematics to practical, real-world challenges. Moreover, I successfully completed the ALX Software Engineering program sponsored by Holberton Inc. in 2023, specializing in backend development.

My hands-on experience in MongoDB, MySQL, Python, C, and Node.js, coupled with proficiency in frontend frameworks such as JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, has equipped me with a diverse and robust skill set. I have leveraged these skills to develop sophisticated mathematical tools using Node.js/Express. I am confident that my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset position me as a strong candidate for this role.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and am eager to discuss further how my skills align with your companyâ€™s needs. Please find attached my CV and certificates for your perusal. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Attah Chisom Moses
