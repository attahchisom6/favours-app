Weekly Update: VacAl Project Update and Next plans

Dear Team
I am writing to share the weekly update and the new plans ahead

This week, we conducted research on several adsumed reasons as to why VacAl, did not make a successful sale during subsequent weeks after the first week of it sale.
Reasons like
i. Does VacAl policies interfere with the govt policies of some of it's vacational sites and does the choice of its vacational sites biased against some areas?

ii. with the payment issues
Does the vacational sites not covered by VacAl a major market for waga sales? Is the norm or VacAl policies directly or indirectly affecting their believe and undermining their cultural practices
Why is there still a sharp rise in the use of third party services despite their shortcomings and inconveniences? Are they operting policies that VacAl chose to ignore

iii. Has Vacal made it easy to book vacational sites any more than the manual, long bureaucratic way of booking vacational sites?
On a scale of 1 - 10. With 10 being the highest probability, how probable are u as the researcher willing to use VacAl over the manual booking or third party services?

I am proud to annouce that we have successfully pinpointed the issue being
1. VacAl bias and inability to include and coperate with some vacational site and their local govt
2. Vacal Payment policy

The company is highly appreciative for team effort made so far.

By next week, we be lookibg to invooarate some, if not all thd vacational site left out of VacAl list of accessible sites and we will also ptocced further with the software ebgineeting team to incoparte a system whrre paynmnebg is fair to all, while using the standard market conversion policy to convert currencies from different nations
