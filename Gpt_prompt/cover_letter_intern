Dear Sir,

I am writing to express my interest in the software engineering intern position at your company. As a graduate of Mathematics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka with second-class honors, I honed my analytical skills, which complement my passion for applying mathematics to real-world problems. I completed the ALX Software Engineering program sponsored by Holberton Inc. in 2023, specializing in backend development.

With hands-on experience in MongoDB, MySQL, Python, C, and Node.js, along with frontend frameworks such as JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, I have developed a diverse skill set. I have utilized these skills to create complex mathematical tools using Node.js/Express. I am confident that my technical abilities and problem-solving mindset make me a strong candidate for this role.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and eager to further discuss how my skills align with your needs. Please find attached my CV and certificates for your review. I am available at your convenience for an interview.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Attah Chisom Moses
