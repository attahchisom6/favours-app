Through a comprehensive analysis of user feedback and market data, our research has uncovered several key factors contributing to the decline in sales for VacAl and its impact on Waga's market share in the vacation and hospitality industry.

Exclusion of Certain Vacation Sites: The decision by VacAl to exclude certain vacation sites has led to feelings of exclusion and discrimination among users in those areas. This exclusion has prompted governments to implement measures promoting third-party usage and even imposing sanctions on citizens who exclusively use VacAl, thus further diminishing its market penetration.

Payment Policies and Currency Conversion: Users have encountered difficulties in converting local currencies to VacAl's standard currency for payment. Moreover, some local governments have deliberately increased conversion rates, adding to the financial burden for users and discouraging adoption of VacAl.

Hostility of Vacation Sites: In some cases, vacation sites allowed by VacAl are inhospitable to visitors in particular areas. This mismatch between user expectations and the reality of the vacation experience has led to dissatisfaction and, in extreme cases, spurred the development of pirated versions of VacAl tailored to suit the needs of marginalized users.

Based on these findings, it is evident that VacAl's payment policies and selective inclusion of vacation sites have significantly contributed to its decline in sales and undermined Waga's market position.

Recommendations:

Review and Revise Payment Policies: VacAl should revisit its payment policies to make currency conversion more accessible and transparent for users, potentially by partnering with local financial institutions to offer competitive rates.

Inclusive Site Selection: VacAl should prioritize inclusivity when selecting vacation sites, ensuring representation and accessibility for users across diverse geographical regions.

Government Engagement and Collaboration: VacAl should engage proactively with governments in regions where it operates to address concerns and foster partnerships that benefit both users and the platform.

Enhanced User Education: VacAl should invest in user education initiatives to increase awareness of available vacation options, payment methods, and potential challenges users may encounter, thereby empowering them to make informed decisions.

By implementing these recommendations, VacAl can mitigate the negative impact of its policies, regain user trust, and strengthen its market position in the vacation and hospitality industry.
