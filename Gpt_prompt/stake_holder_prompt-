From our research finding during the last week, we were able to pinpoint the major reason why VacAI an AI powered app built by Waga to enable users book vacational sites experienced down sales from the second week upwards, these are
1. VacAl intentional or unintentional discrimination to certain vacational sites, making it impoesible fo users to book such aite
2. Ineffficient payment policy causing fraud wen users try to convert their currency to waga's accepted currency

Assume u are product manager with the name Attah Noses, write an email to stakeholders using the link Waga-Vacal@stakeholders.org telling them we have incopirated features that made it oossible for users to pay in thei local by build internal engine to make the conversion of currency to the standard accepted one.
we have also incoporated every site that was not incoporate earlier while interacting witg their govt to ensures no rules/conduct or curtural practices was undermined by Vacal.
Write that u will be presenting a prototype documentation
Request the opinion of the stakeholders regarding the matter
Add any otger thing that should included in this email
pls use a proffessional tone that agree to the stakeholder settimg/environment (most of them can be hardcore data-oriented analyst)
