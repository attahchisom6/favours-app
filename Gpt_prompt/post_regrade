Good evening all. I hope this message finds u well. It's been about 4 weeks since i reported a case of wrongly reviewed milestones. Indeed it was very discouraging and upon so many people here adviced me to not give up cuz the mentor team, as i was told, would make the review in subsequent times. However, as i speak to u now, my milestone reviewed as 99.5% still shows 0% on my score board , milestone 2, was the result of me quiting every other thing i was supposed to do so as to focus on AICE, i worked tirelessly during that week 2 for full 7 days! (I was like why was my milestone 1 showing 0% even when reviewed as 99.5%, so i put even more effort), but as soon as soon as i submitted it, in no less than a minute, it has been reviewed! Just like that! 42%? For seven days work? It evident  the guy did not read through my work. So i came here to ask, should i still be patient? Will my plea be considered? Pls i need ur help in this matter
