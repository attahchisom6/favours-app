Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Backend Software Engineer position at Ecotech, as advertised. With a strong foundation in backend development and proficiency in the MERN stack, I am eager to contribute to your team and tackle technical challenges with enthusiasm.

As a recent graduate of the ALX software engineering program powered by Holberton Inc., and the AICE AI program sponsored by ALX, I have honed my skills in Python, JavaScript, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL, among others. My academic background in Mathematics from the University of Nigeria Nsukka has equipped me with a problem-solving mindset, essential for addressing complex algorithmic and database challenges.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with a dynamic team. I am committed to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies to meet evolving industry demands.

In my previous role as a Backend Developer, I developed a sophisticated calculator application using Express.js and handled complex arithmetic operations, including trigonometry, logarithms, and number base conversions. Additionally, I have experience in DevOps, hosting applications on cloud servers and configuring reverse proxies for seamless user experiences.

I am particularly drawn to Ecotech because of its commitment to innovation and its remote work culture. I am confident that my technical skills, coupled with my dedication to excellence, make me a valuable asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of the Company.

Sincerely,

Attah Moses
