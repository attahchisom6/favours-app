VacAl is an app used in booking vacational sites.
Create mobile user interfaces for VacAI so that it forms a solution to the following issues
1. More vacational sites are added/displayed so that users have more options to choose from
2. Users have the option to pay in any currency they dim fit
3. There is QR code in each page of the app to ensure the originality of the app is maintained hence eliminating piracy

every image generated should be displayed in a standing form (vertically), so that all features in each screen can be clearly deciphered
